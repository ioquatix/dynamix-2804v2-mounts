# Dynamix 2804v2 Mounts

This repository contains a number of parts which assist with mounting equipment to the [Dynamix HWS-* style cabinets]([http://www.dynamix.co.nz/home/netwbs/shw100/HWS-2804V2](https://www.dynamix.co.nz/78245)).

## Motivation

I like to keep my networking gear tidy. This enclosure is a good one but there is no easy way to mount equipment which slots on to screw heads.

## Parts Required

- M3 bolts and nuts for mounting as required, length depends on equipment being mounted. M3x6 is useful.

## Instructions

These parts are relatively simple to use, simply print them out and they should pressure fit into the back of the cabinet.
